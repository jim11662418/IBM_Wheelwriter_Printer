# wheelwriter-printer
A Dallas Semiconductor DS89C440 MCU turns an IBM Wheelwriter Electronic typewriter into a Windows "Generic/Text Only" Printer. 
The Wheelwriter prints characters received from the PC's parallel port or serial port, or entered through a PS/2 keyboard.

The MCU connects to the J1P "Feature" connector on the Wheelwriter's Printer Board.
